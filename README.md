# Small interface for image manipulation

## Description

This is a small program for image manipulation, which gives the ability to apply different convolutional filters to an image with some preset filters such as:
- Box blur
- Gaussian blur
- Gaussian filter
- Sharpen
- Grey
- Corrected grey
- Basic edge detection
- Sobel operator
- Prewitt operator
- Roberts cross operator
- Custom 5x5 kernels

It also has a small interface for manipulating color channels, such as swapping them or multiplying specific channels by a scalar with a slider.

The images can then be saved to and loaded from the images folder.
